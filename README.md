Advanced Backtesting Tool
My Advanced Backtesting Tool is a cutting-edge framework designed to rigorously evaluate trading strategies under various market conditions. Unlike traditional backtesting tools, this system uses a combination of Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO) and Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV) to eliminate look-ahead bias and overfitting, providing a more accurate assessment of strategy performance.
